this is currently a WIP and doesnt work.
should be easy to do, i just got bored and stopped.

i initially started doing this because coolstar
kept xz support in his port and i wanted to counter him,
but i realized that i was being stupid... so i stopped lol

basically clone this repo:

https://salsa.debian.org/dpkg-team/dpkg.git

and then replace configure.ac with the other one, then do configure, make.
and theoretically you should just be able to run aite but im not done yet
so you gotta do the rest of the porting, refer to build_log.txt and basically
translate that to aite stuff.
